# Improvement: Shape Improvements

This change improves curve sequencing.

## Curves spanning multiple steps

Adds the ability to make a curve span over multiple steps.

### Guide

1. Open a curve track
2. Select multiple steps (**SHIFT** + **Sx**)
3. Hold **SHIFT** and turn the encoder to select a shape

The shape will be spread across the selected steps.

Not holding **SHIFT** will result in the original behaviour - all selected steps are set to the same shape.

### Extra features

- While holding **SHIFT** with multiple steps selected, pressing the encoder will reverse the shape across the selected steps

## Extra shapes

Adds more shapes.

Added shapes:

- Half ramp up: same as ramp up, but half a step
- Half ramp down: same as ramp down, but half a step
- Half exponential up: same as exponential up, but half a step
- Half exponential down: same as exponential down, but half a step
- Half log up: same as log up, but half a step
- Half log down: same as log down, but half a step
- Half smooth up: same as smooth up, but half a step
- Half smooth down: same as smooth down, but half a step
